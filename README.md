## Hello there! 

You've reached the voicemail box of Matt Polito, Senior Engineer @ [Hashrocket](https://hashrocket.com). He can't come to the phone right now as he's busy building wonderful software [for clients](https://hashrocket.com/work), [the dev community](https://github.com/mattpolito?tab=repositories), [and himself](https://github.com/mattpolito/digital_movies). 

Please leave a message at any of the social links provided and he'll get back to you as soon as possible.

## Would you like to know more?

I'm just a guy who loves the simple things in life, and that love translates to an ability to see the simple solutions in complex development problems.

Having spent many years helping build up the Ruby community in Chicago, I was able to have a wonderful opportunity working with both [Obtiva](https://obtiva.com), [Groupon](https://groupon.com) and now Hashrocket (10 years!). 

In addition to development work I really enjoy participating in and assisting in the growth of several user groups and conferences such as: [ChicagoRuby](https://chicagoruby.org), [WindyCityRails](https://windycityrails.com), [RubyJax](http://rubyjax.org), [Ancient City Ruby](https://ancientcityruby.com), and [RubyConf](https://rubyconf.org).

I tend to not be very social on the social networks but definitely love replying when asked questions... so ask away!
